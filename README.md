# Exact project count

The ability to see how many projects a Scratch studio has was removed from the Scratch website, so I wrote a short JavaScript program that counts projects using the API. It is available [on the web](https://mxmou.github.io/exactcount/) and as a [userscript](https://mxmou.github.io/exactcount/exactcount.user.js).
