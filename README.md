# Exact project count

The ability to see how many projects a Scratch studio has been removed from the Scratch website, so I wrote a short JavaScript program that counts projects using the API. It is available [on the web](https://mxmou.github.io/exactcount/) or as a [userscript](https://mxmou.github.io/exactcount/exactcount.user.js) (not actively updated). A modified version of it is included in [Scratch Addons](https://scratchaddons.com/).
